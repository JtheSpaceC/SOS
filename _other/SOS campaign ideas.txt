Generate a campaign of 5 missions or so. Win/lose them. Persist your forces through each campaign.
You essentially beat a nemesis/Lieutenant in each campaign, but each Lieutenant can contribute to a major attack by the enemy, so you have a time limit.
You get paid at the end of a campaign, but can take an advance for 10% (or so) less overall payout.

Perks of the enemy could include:
* Listening station. Jamming is ineffective across all missions in this sector.
* Factory. Sends +1 to the war effort every day, by ship (can intercept or steal ship).
* Missile defense ship (shoots down missiles)
* Refinery. Near the main mining operation. Gives bounty hunters confidence in the ability to pay. Enables bounty hunters
* Repair Facilities. Repairs fighter hull damage at a greater rate
* Arms cache. Missiles, etc are stored here and enable missiles
* Mine field. Offers a back way in to the main base
* Plutonium mine. Can manke nukes/EMP
* Drone Factory

Radar/Comms jamming. A shuttle can equip jamming equipment and jam 1 ship. Lv1 is noisy, so the ship might launch a drone or shuttle. Lv2 is silent so if you approach silenty you could catch them by surprise.

Enemy (or gas cloud) could jam your radar, fuzzing it up, but with a squad upgrade you could all see what's in line of sight of each other.

If you kill a nemesis with a bombing run on their station, you'll kill civilians and generate another 1-2 nemeses (of a lower level)

Choose roles for up to 12 pilots (1 for fighter, 2 - 3 for Shuttle, 2 for Bomber)

You can send a shuttle or Stealth Fighter in (by sublight) a day before a mission to give you a better chance to ambush, or better intel.

You can invest a pilot (or agent) as a spy early in the campaign. They've a chance to be captured (not killed) in which case you can resuce them randomly in a mission. If they live they'll be placed in a random position after a few days (including as an enemy fighter) and you can activate them at will.
Activation Powers Include:
* Disable a ship's systems
* Find another Cell
* Reduce enemy campaign progress
* Steal a ship/technology

If you lure in an enemy ship and damage its engines, it will be at that location for the next couple of days, which you could exploit.

The present campaign/nemesis is your primary concern at a given time, but if left too long (and a progress bar fills) then either there'll be an attack on your home base, or on a civilian base, resulting in an evac mission, and pirates establishing a base in that sector.

Early NPC relation needs to be better than you and help you, so you feel their loss.

Scouting an enemy installation without a stealth fighter will raise its defenses (meaning more enemies on the map initially, before reinforcements).

When entering a new sector, enemy isn't aware of you. If you make no enemies survive your first engagements you'll have the advantage for longer.
This could mean choosing not to attack a well defended convoy just to maintain the element of surprise.

Enemy ship names vs your own is the first clue that you're the bad guy

Find a base, supply route, or mini-base randomly

COULD GO OUT ON OUTINGS IN AN OPEN WORLD SENSE AND ONLY GO BACK WHEN TIRED OR FOR UPGRADES OR TO ADVANCE TIME


DECK CREW
Can repair x amount of hull damage per day
